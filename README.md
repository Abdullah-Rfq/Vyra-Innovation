# Vyra Innovations — Website

A simple, responsive static website for Vyra Innovations (dark, premium theme).

## What's included
- `index.html` — homepage (featured courses)
- `courses.html` + `courses/*` — course listings and detail pages (Full-Stack, Cloud & DevOps, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Mobile Apps, AI & ML, UX/UI)
- `about.html`, `contact.html`, `success.html`
- `styles.css`, `script.js`, `assets/*`

## Deploy
- Netlify: drag & drop the folder or link your Git repo and deploy. Netlify will pick `index.html`.
- Forms: Contact form uses Netlify Forms (no server required). Submission redirects to `success.html`.

## Local testing
Open `index.html` in the browser. For full Netlify Forms test, deploy to Netlify.

## Next steps (suggested)
- Replace placeholder assets with real logo/photography
- Connect an email provider or notification (Netlify build notifications, or use Zapier)
- Add analytics (Plausible/GA) and SEO improvements
